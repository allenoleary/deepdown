.INT - DAY SOPHIE AND ANDY'S FLAT


SOPHIE sits at a kitchen table, working a laptop, a bread roll clumsily stuffed with ham is drying on a plate beside her. She is engrossed with her task, scrubbing backwards and forwards over an editing program time-line, images of oil spills, of nuclear wastelands, of children picking over rubbish tips.

ANDY sits beside her, a bowl of soup in his hands. He dunks some French bread in it.

ANDY
Scaring the shit out of yourself again?

SOPHIE
This shit is real.

ANDY
I know that. 

SOPHIE
We are so screwed.

ANDY
Yes and no.

SOPHIE
How many years?

ANDY
If we stopped all emissions now. Three hundred.

SOPHIE
If we stopped now.

ANDY
We'll find a way. People just have to see. We have to make them see.

Sophie steals the French bread out of Andy's hand.

SOPHIE
Right.

ANDY
We should get some proper food. Tomorrow is going to be a long day.

SOPHIE
I just want to finish this...

ANDY
Right.

SOPHIE
Is there a problem?

ANDY
Nope.

Andy stands up, back off.

.INT DAY - BEDROOM










INT. SUPER PUMA HELICOPTER - DAY

The North Sea steadily spools beneath the helicopter, flat and glinting in the sunlight.

In the back Sophie sits next to Andy, their knees playfully jostling each other. Emily looks on disapprovingly while next to her Havers nonchalantly checks his iPhone. They are all wearing bulky bright

orange survival suits.

On another bench Flint and Ralph look out the window, following the direction of the their guide, FLETCHER - a youngish weather-beaten scot.

Emily slaps Sophie on the leg, Sophie jumps to it, picks up her camera, goes to the window, confidently sets the camera and starts shooting.

EXT. NORTH SEA - DAY

The helicopter sprints in low towards an oil rig, prickling fierce with booms, derricks and cranes - a victory of engineering and logic over the capricious ocean and it's well guarded treasure.

As the helicopter circles the rig getting ready to land, we can see there are two separate halves of the rig joined by a long high walkway.

FLETCHER
(O.S)
Hotel on the right where we sleep, rig on the left.

HAVERS
People live on that?

FLETCHER
Some of us call it home.

The Helicopter zeros in on the Helipad.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

The company, now divested of their survival suits, walk through an interior corridor, lugging various tote bags and cases with them.

For the first time we see that Flint is pregnant.

It's a cold, masculine environment, bare steel and edges given the least possible decoration to make this place livable.

Everywhere safety labels, extinguishers, comms stations.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - DAY

Brian looks down a list on his clipboard.

FLETCHER

FLETCHER
Mrs Flint...

Flint looks into her pokey cabin and flinches.

FLETCHER
This is the largest available.

FLINT
Thank you.

She peels off and closes the door.

FLETCHER
Andy you are here... Sophie next.

They both push in their doors and enter.

EMILY

I want to see you all in the lounge in fifteen for a meeting. Make that ten.

Havers tries to see into their cabins.

HAVERS
So we have our own baths right?

FLETCHER
You have your own crapper. Sir could bathe in that if he wishes.

HAVERS
No need to get arsey...

FLETCHER
I'm a Doctor. But here I am baby sitting a bunch of media pansies from the mainland. I'll be as arsey as I want, understood?

Havers shrugs.

Fletcher moves further down the corridor with the remaining visitors.

A moment later Sophie pops her head out and checks no one is looking, then pushes into Andy's cabin.

INT - RALPH'S BEDROOM - DAY

Ralph goes over his room with some distaste.

The small sink has a bottle of Lynx after shave on it which he throws away in disgust.

The closet door doesn't close, no matter how many times he pushes it.

On a notice board is a family photo - an oil worker, his wife and a couple of kids. The wife has had her face erased with obsessive sharp strokes of a biro.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

The TV crew, Flint and Ralph are assembled in a lounge area. Efforts have been made to make it more comfortable - there are sofas, a massive screen and projector, DVD library, a pile of thrillers and a basic kitchenette.

Ralph hands Flint a cup of coffee.

Emily, 'dressed down' in perfectly ironed jeans, brand new Timberlands and an expensive gortex jacket, is handing out schedules.

EMILY
Then straight after the official opening we'll come back in here and Mrs Flint and the CEO of Shexobil will hold a press briefing to the assembled press.

HAVERS
That's me. I'm the assembled press.

EMILY
And?

HAVERS
Couldn't you just say a press briefing with William Havers?

EMILY
Shall I reprint all these schedules for you? Would that make you happy?

HAVERS
Something for next time.

Emily goes back to handing out the call sheets.

Sophie rolls her eyes at Havers, he winks back - an old game this, winding up Emily.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Andy and Sophie are setting up cameras and microphones around a small table.

Andy drops a cloth with the Shexobil logo on it behind the table. Sophie zooms into it, sharpens the focus and shoots it for a second.

On the other side of the room, in a cluster of sofas, sit Emily, Havers and Flint. Ralph hovers nearby.

HAVERS
That's just the same old party line Flint.

FLINT
It's called policy. The new generation of nuclear reactors don't come online for ten years. This new deep-drilling platform will keep us energy independent until that time.

HAVERS
But you say we are are decreasing our reliance on oil.

FLINT
In the long term we will do exactly that, but our current priority is to increase energy independence.

HAVERS
We don't want pesky arabs and mad russians in the mix?

FLINT
Your words, not mine.

EMILY
Lets save the rest for the interview shall we?

Andy taps a microphone. Sophie, in cans, nods.

ANDY
(into mic)
Bullshit and jellybeans are what I have for dinner, it may not taste nice but it stops me getting thinner.

Sophie smiles.

Ralph taps Andy on the shoulder and hands him a large envelope.

Andy slips a small stick-on Conservative party logo out of the envelope and fixes it next to the large dominating Shexobil logo.

INT. LOUNGE AREA, KITCHENETTE - DAY

Sophie leans up against the bench. Andy is opening every cupboard, looking for something.

SOPHIE
What are you doing?

ANDY
Looking for fun.

Kneeling on the floor he opens a cupboard between her legs.

ANDY
Found it!

SOPHIE
You're not getting anything here.

Andy buries his head in her crotch and makes bear noises, she laughs and pushes him away.

Flint walks in.

FLINT
Hard at work?

ANDY
Absolutely. Check this out...

Andy pulls out a large chrome machine, plonks it on the bench.

ANDY
A proper coffee maker!

FLINT
So fire it up.

Andy plugs it in, fills it with water, pushes the right buttons.

FLINT
So what do you two think?

ANDY
About what?

FLINT
About putting a billion pounds of taxpayer's money into an oil rig.

ANDY
Honestly?

FLINT
Honestly.

ANDY
Well, Minister, I think it's a short-sighted move that makes it look like you don't really care about climate change. But then you don't really care about it do you?

FLINT
We're planning decades ahead.

ANDY
You're planning for business as usual. No one takes the hard decisions.

Andy turns back to the machine - he opens one of the coffee caddies and spoons a tablespoon of coffee into it before putting it back into the machine and sliding a cup under it.

FLINT
You've done that before.

ANDY
Three years of Starbucks to put me through University.

FLINT
So you suck up to the establishment when you have to.

ANDY
I hacked the till and ran a Student Green lobby off the take.

FLINT
A politician after all. What about you?

SOPHIE
I admire Andy's optimism, I can even see the good in what you are doing, but I think it's too late.

FLINT
Too late for what?

SOPHIE
Everything. I think the population of the planet will number a couple of million at best in a hundred years. Which means about 6 billion people are going to suffer in one way or another. Famine, extreme weather, economic upheaval, personal tragedy. I think we are all pissing in the wind, that we've had a party for the last three hundred years and we are now going to drown in a vomit of iphones. And we will have deserved it.

Andy whips the cup off the machine.

ANDY
How do you have it?

FLINT
Black. You don't believe in trying?

SOPHIE
It's too late. All that we can do is plan to make the end as painless as possible. That should be your job.

FLINT
I am so glad I have hope, a sense of mission. I would hate to be like you.

SOPHIE
I have my own mission, filming the end of the world. That big enough for you?

Andy hands Flint her coffee.

ANDY
Careful, it's hot.

Flint takes it, has a sip.

FLINT
Perfect. Have fun now, kids.

She leaves.

ANDY
She's just jealous 'cause she's not getting any.

SOPHIE
She must have got some...

ANDY
That was months ago.

He snuggles up to Sophie and they get physical.

Emily appears from nowhere.

EMILY
I never want to see this in work time, do you hear? Up on deck, now!

Startled, they scuttle out of the kitchenette.

EXT. HIGH WALKWAY - DAY

Fletcher is being filmed by Sophie and Andy, high above the platform. Emily is clutching desperately to the railing, ill with vertigo.

FLETCHER
This rig goes twice as deep as any before, drilling for deposits three miles under the sea floor. With the increased depth comes more oil pressure, but even so this the safest rig ever built.

Sophie pans down off the Brian and into the depths of the rig, onto some OIL MEN working the rig. She cuts and comes back up.

EMILY
Great Fletcher. Can you tell us how the drilling is going?

FLETCHER
It's going very well so far we

SOPHIE
Fletcher, wait a sec.

Sophie resets on him and records, gives him the thumbs up.

FLETCHER
It's going well, we've broken the world record a month ago and are due to reach three miles today, at the same time we should hit the deposit we are looking for. In fact

EMILY
Cut it.

Sophie cuts.

EMILY

EMILY
Can we please get down? It's making me...

She drops to her knees and tosses a pile of vomit into the centre of the rig.

Cries come up from the Oil men below.

INT. MOON POOL - DAY

One BURLY OIL MAN looks up to the sky and wipes sick off his sleeve with a dirty rag.

Other Oil Men clap each other on the back as a big splash of paint '3 miles of cock' on the drill pipe passes through the floor.

EXT. OCEAN - DAY

The massive shape of the rig silhouetted and shifting in the water... we plunge down the drill bit, the rig rapidly becoming smaller, the water darker and then black.

The drill pipe enters the ocean floor, flood lit by the heavy construction built around the entry point.

The drill pipe is a long thin line slicing down into the crust of the earth. Falling down it and coming closer and closer we can see the tip, diamond encrusted, forever grinding down.

Suddenly it breaks through into empty space - the bit swims in black, keeps going down and hits something else...

There is an almighty scream and something very large thrashes in the void. It's shape is indistinct like a giant slug, its body vast. What could be called blood bursts from it's seething mass where the drill pierces it.

Blood. Oil.

The drill plunges deeper into it, flesh writhing around the cold steel of the bit.

There's a massive jolt as the oil hits the bit at huge pressure and starts to shoot up the pipe.

INT - MOON POOL - DAY

The pipe gives an almighty kick. Everyone stops

immediately and sprints back from the pipe. The Burly Oil Man hits a panic button and a siren starts its urgent harping.

EXT. HIGH WALKWAY - DAY

Sophie is shooting off the walkway as the alarm starts to shriek.

FLETCHER
They've hit oil. You need to get back to the Hotel now, all hell's about to break loose.

EMILY
Thank god, we can get down...

Emily starts to scurry to the end of the walkway.

SOPHIE
I need to shoot it.

FLETCHER
You need your fucking head read lassie.

ANDY

Sophie...

SOPHIE
I'm sick of filming politicians, I want some real action.

Fletcher gives her a very close look - she doesn't flinch.

ANDY
Me too.

FLETCHER
Are your balls as big as hers?

Andy nods.

FLETCHER
Follow me then lassies...

The three of them turn around and quickly walk the other way on the walkway.

From the other end of the walkway Emily shouts at them.

EMILY
What are you doing? Come back!

Ignored, she starts to scramble back down the ladder.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT

Sophie stands at a dimmer switch, pulls the lights down to low.

Andy sits at a laptop hooked up to a projector, black screen.

ANDY
It's rough.

He hits the spacebar and the footage starts.

.MONTAGE:

A shot of the moon pool flooding with oil.

Another where a massive shock rocks the platform and Fletcher just about falls over.

Men running across the walkway back to the hotel.

FIRE CREWS taking position.

A massive burn off - hundreds of feet of flame jetting from the burn off mast.

The 'all clear given' - fire crew collapse with relief.

Oil men slapping each other on the back, relieved nothing worse has happened.

Andy pauses the footage.

HAVERS
My God that was scary.

EMILY
They are all insane, totally insane.

FLETCHER
Most men do a couple of years, earn their house deposit and then piss off again.

SOPHIE
And you?

FLETCHERS
Ten years so far. I am insane.

EMILY

FLETCHERS
Thank god we'll be off this thing tomorrow.

Andy reverse scrolls the footage and it begins to skip and shudder backwards.

INT. EARTH'S CRUST - NIGHT

The bulky creature is still in pain.

The drill pierces into the flesh and oil keeps pumping up it.

Deep in the creatures veins something moves. It's snakelike but has no eyes. It swims towards the pipe, noses around the tip and nudges into the hollow centre, letting itself get sucked up...

INT. LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT

A couple of hours later and everyone is drinking, except the pregnant Flint. The mood is more relaxed, Havers is sprawled out on a couch with a glass of wine, Flint is reading a 'Motherhood' magazine.

Andy, Ralph and Sophie are tanked and having an argument.

ANDY
The Gaia theory says that the Earth is literally a single living organism.

RALPH
The earth is a system. It has inputs and outputs. We've screwed it up but we can make it better.

ANDY
The teahnical solution... Would you rather be treated like a human or a machine?

RALPH
That's not the point.

SOPHIE
The point is we are all completely fucked.

FLINT
I'm so glad I am having a child.

EMILY
Bad move don't you think?

FLINT
What do you mean?

EMILY
You're an MP. This will end your career.

FLINT
I'm surrounded by optimists.

EMILY
Not that you've had much of a career so far. You were lucky to be made Energy Minister, Cameron need some dolly birds on cabinet eh?

FLINT
That must have been it.

EMILY
Just as well hubby's a industry leader eh, you can ride him once you're out.

FLINT
I'm doing my best to take this in good humour, but you are running out of strikes.

Emily shrugs her off.

HAVERS
Ladies and Gentlemen here is my solution to the imminent decline of civilisation as we know it.

All eyes on him.

HAVERS
Eating. Drinking. The animal pleasures.

EMILY
Here we go...

FLINT
Fiddling while Rome burns?

HAVERS
Fucking while Rome burns. Wanna show me how it's done Flint?

She holds up her 'Motherhood' magazine.

FLINT
Great offer Havers, but I've got other things on my mind.

There's a jarring crash to the rig, drinks are spilled.

Everyone is electrified.

ANDY
What the fuck was that?

No one moves.

EXT. MOON POOL - NIGHT

The pipes are kicking about, giving the Oil Men a hard time. It's gets so bad they have to step back. One oil man goes to push the panic button, but the clanging and shuddering inexplicably stops.

The men approach the pipes again - everything is fine.

On the wet steel floor the Snake from beneath moves unseen. It's pale, translucent, no limbs or sense organs as all - it's just pure intention, an urge to movement, an unknown creature with an unknown mission...

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Andy and Sophie stagger up the hallway, holding onto each other, giggling and well gone.

Andy reaches into his pocket and fishes out a joint.

From the other pocket he pulls out a polished and much loved zippo lighter. He slashes them in the light.

SOPHIE
We don't have time for that...

Sophie pushes Andy against the wall and gives him a sloppy drunk kiss.

Andy kicks open the door to his cabin and she pushes him inside.

INT. ANDY'S CABIN - NIGHT

She kicks the door closed behind - it bangs shut and then springs open an inch or two.

They collapse on the bed, Andy on top.

SOPHIE
Quickly... come on!

ANDY
Ok ok...

Andy struggles out of his pants while Sophie flails around with her hands, reaching for the stash of condoms. She gets one, rips it open and gets it ready for Andy.

SOPHIE
Ready then?

ANDY
Oh yeah...

They get it on...

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Slipping up the corridor the Snake is looking for something - it passes Andy's door then senses something, stops.

It heads back to the barely open door...

INT. ANDY'S CABIN - NIGHT

Andy is well on his way to orgasm and Sophie is chasing him hard.

The snake slides across the floor, glides up the foot of the bed - there in front of it is Andy's arse, pumping away.

Andy is about to come, he screws his eyes closed, his face seized in effort and bliss.

ANDY
I'm coming, I'm coming...

SOPHIE
That's it... come on baby...

Suddenly his eyes open and he freezes...

Sophie looks up at him, disbelieving.

SOPHIE
Don't stop now...

Andy goes white.

ANDY
There's something down there.

SOPHIE
What the fuck are you talking about?

Andy puts his fingers to his lips. Sophie sees he's for real and shuts up quick.

Andy looks behind him...

He screams and twists off Sophie, backing up over the top of her.

The glimmer of something twisting out the door.

ANDY
Did you see that?

Sophie pushes him off her and starts fishing around for the condom.

SOPHIE
What?

ANDY
A snake. A white snake.

SOPHIE
Give me a break...

ANDY
It was a fucking snake!

SOPHIE
Hey Romeo, look...

She holds up the condom.

SOPHIE
Ripped. Great.

ANDY
There was a snake in this room, I felt it on my arse.

SOPHIE
If I'm pregnant a fucking snake will be the last of your worries...

She pushes him out of bed with her feet and pulls the covers back over herself.

Andy reaches into his trouser pockets and pulls out the joint and lighter - he strikes the zippo and it leaps into flame.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Flint pads up the hall in her dressing gown and fluffy slippers with a big glass of milk, enters her room.

INT. FLINT'S CABIN - NIGHT

She sips from the milk then settles back into bed and pops an eye-mask on, as she turns off her light there is the glint of something that looks like coiled rope on the floor.

Flint snores, her mouth hanging open.

The snake slips up the side of the bed and moves towards Flint's mouth. It pauses there, it's head moving around her face as if deciding something.

With sudden force it drives into Flints mouth, all of it's length disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Flint wakes instantly, gagging, snatches off her mask and sits upright. She takes a moment to come to herself.

Switching on the light she looks around. Nothing.

She takes a sip of milk. Then greedily drains the glass, lays back down.

EXT. OIL RIG - DAY

Early morning light cuts over the horizon and onto the rig - there's not a cloud in the sky, it's going to be a great day.

Some Oil Men stand on a high walkway taking in the view, the sun on the water, the sheer beauty of the day.

INT. ANDY'S CABIN - DAY

Light cuts across the bed. Sophie lies in Andy's arms, asleep, content.

She wakes, eyes open. She reaches down to feel her stomach, a flicker of anxiety crosses her brow.

She gets up and starts to dress.

Andy watches her. She looks back to him. He smiles. She ruffles his hair, kisses him on the top of the head, keeps getting dressed.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

In the kitchenette Ralph is making two cups of coffee.

He hands one to the immaculately dressed Flint. She

sniffs it.

FLINT
What's this?

RALPH
Coffee, as usual.

FLINT
It's not strong enough.

He looks at her curiously then takes the cup back.

Flint feels a kick in her guts. She quickly puts her hands down there, feeling the baby... and there's another one.

FLINT
It's moving, the baby is moving!

Ralph has no idea what to say.

RALPH
Is that good?!

FLINT
It's wonderful Ralph, just wonderful...

She breaks into a big smile, full of excitement and motherly pride.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Sophie sits with FLETCHER.

FLETCHER
I'm sorry to disappoint you lassie but we don't stock them. Not much call for them, it's a male only ship.

Sophie wilts.

FLETCHER
I can write you a prescription. When are you back to shore?

SOPHIE
Later today.

FLETCHER
That's ok then, you get 48 hours. Shall I write it?

Sophie nods. He starts typing into a laptop.

FLETCHER
You've never had to take one before have you?

She shakes her head.

FLETCHER
Is he a good man - a good man for you?

She smiles.

SOPHIE
He is.

FLETCHER
Get him to spoil you for few days all right?

SOPHIE
Did you ever have anyone to look after?

FLETCHER
It's a long story involving a Ford Capri, infidelity and a dog called Mr T.

SOPHIE
Really?

FLETCHER
The infidelity part is true.

SOPHIE
I'd like to hear it one day.

FLETCHER
No deal. It just makes me cry, and that's something you do not want to see.

He hands her the prescription. She takes it.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Everyone is getting ready for the big day, topping up coffees, a croissant.

Sophie closes her phone, rolls her eyes at Havers, leaves.

HAVERS
You didn't do anything to her did you?

FLINT
What?

HAVERS
Emily. She should be here by now. It's not like she can miss her train is it.

FLINT
Why would I do anything to her?!

HAVERS
Sorry about her behaviour last night, she's an ugly drunk.

FLINT
You can talk. Ralph?

Ralph springs to attention.

FLINT
Another coffee please.

RALPH
Do you really need a fifth cup? Is it good for the baby?

FLINT
Just do it Ralph.

Ralph looks concerned, but heads back to the kitchenette as told.

INT. EMILY'S CABIN - DAY

Emily is in bed, completely still - asleep?

Sophie stands looking at her, not able to come any closer.

Fletcher rushes in behind her, crosses to Emily's bed checks for breath and pulse.

Nothing.

He raises the sheets. No visible signs of damage - she still looks like she is sleeping.

FLETCHER
That's really weird.

SOPHIE
What?

FLETCHER
People her age don't just die of nothing.

He puts the sheet back over Emily.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Sophie is addressing the film crew, Flint and Ralph.

SOPHIE
Fletcher says it looks like natural causes.

HAVERS
Poor thing.

Sophie gives him a look.

HAVERS
I didn't like her, but I didn't want her dead.

SOPHIE
The question is what do we do now?

ANDY
Get through today as best we can and go home tonight.

FLINT
We're all here, we should continue.

SOPHIE
But who's going to produce?

HAVERS
You are. She was useless anyway.

ANDY
A bit of respect Havers...

HAVERS
It's true. Come on Sophie

FLINT
It's a press conference and 10 minutes footage. Christ even I could do that.

SOPHIE
We wouldn't want you to go out of your way Minister...

ANDY
So you're the boss Sophie.

SOPHIE
Ok, decisions then. Havers, lets do your footage first.

HAVERS
A producer who makes me work? I hate you already...

Havers gets up.

RALPH
Hold on...

Ralph straightens Havers' tie.

HAVERS
I didn't know you cared.

RALPH
Couldn't have you share a clip with Flint looking like that.

Havers gives him a light slap in the face and steps off.

EXT. RIG PLATFORM - DAY

Sophie and Andy are shooting Havers - in the background Oil Men work on maintenance tasks.

HAVERS
As well as being the biggest this is also the safest oil rig ever built, with state of the art warning and escape systems.

INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

A couple of Oil men are being run through first aid techniques on a surprisingly life-sike mannequin by Fletcher. They try not to laugh.

Havers does his piece to camera in the foreground.

HAVERS
Everyone on the rig is regularly trained in first aid. First aid and mannekin fellatio.

The oil men crack up. Sophie flicks off the camera and sighs.

INT. WEATHER STATION - DAY

An OFFICER examines weather gear - a big weather radar dominates.

Sophie and Andy continue to film.

OFFICER

HAVERS
This new generation weather radar shows what's happening for fifty miles. For instance you can see...

Something concerns him. Sophie zooms into the screen.

OFFICER
That's, ahhh, a highly unusual local activity... hold on...

He puts his head out the door, still being filmed by Sophie.

Outside it's getting dark very quickly and the wind starts to whistle in the rigging. Floodlights flicker on.

Sophie pans up to catch a helicopter struggling to find the landing deck.

EXT. HELIPAD - DAY

The CEO of Shexobil DAVID UNDERWOOD, a slick and handsome 60, struggles to remain upright in the wind.

Shaking hands with him is Flint - being held upright by Ralph.

EXT - DRILING HEAD - DAY

Sophie films, Andy holds the boom over Flint as she talks, buffeted by squalls of wind that eddie down into the rig.

Andy shakes his head at Sophie - can't hear a thing.

Flint steps forward with Underwood, a bottle of champagne in her hand. It's tied to a line from above.

She swings it forward but the wind catches it and it veers from it's course.

She tries again, same thing.

She steps in, grabs the bottle by the neck and smashes it forcefully over the drilling head.

Everyone claps - Flint turns back to massed crowd.

There's a shard of glass sticking out of her hand.

Sophie zooms in on it.

Flint casually reaches down and pulls it out and discards it on the floor.

Sophie pans up to Flint's face - an impassive mask.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Lights on to compensate for the early darkness outside, Flint and Underwood sit at the table in front of the drop cloth, still looking a little damp.

Sophie is shooting off a tripod, over Havers' shoulder.

Underwood looks at Flint like she is insane.

HAVERS
Hold on, let me slow you down there Flint, what you've just said is in complete contradiction what you told me just yesterday.

FLINT
The rape of the earth must stop. We must learn to live within our means, to save the planet for our children and our children's children.

Silence.

Sophie looks out from behind the camera to Andy who gives her the thumbs up, he's loving this.

Havers is struggling with this radical change in direction.

HAVERS
Ah... ok... so what about energy independence and the nuclear programme?

FLINT
Independence is a nonsense when it comes to resources. No one wants to hear this, but we must work closer with our allies not move away from them. And this includes Russian and the Middle East. If we can't work together we will all end up dying alone.

HAVERS
A stark message for our viewers.

Underwood looks ashen.

UNDERWOOD
But you've given us over a billion pounds towards this rig, surely you don't intend to withdraw that money?

FLINT
I will be doing everything in my power to make sure that this rig ceases drilling as soon as possible.

Underwood stands and leaves the table.

HAVERS
And on that bombshell, we'll close for today.

Sophie cuts. Ralph springs to Flint's side. Havers stands up and has a stretch.

UNDERWOOD
What the fuck do you think you're doing? We've just opened this thing and you want to shut it down? Are you fucking mad?!

FLINT
We'll be in touch David.

UNDERWOOD
To fucking right we will, my lawyers will be all over this. Does Cameron know about this?

FLINT
When's this going live Havers?

HAVERS
As soon as humanly possible Minister.

FLINT
There's your answer. Now, can we get a lift with you back to mainland?

UNDERWOOD
I've got a body to take back, get your own fucking helicopter.

Underwood storms out.

Flint sits back down, completely unphased.

Ralph crosses to Havers and Sophie.

RALPH
I think it would be unwise to release that.

HAVERS
On what grounds Ralph?

RALPH

HAVERS
Christ I don't know... temporary insanity?

SOPHIE
Has anyone ever got away with murder for being pregnant?

RALPH
After that display I wouldn't be surprised.

SOPHIE
Andy, get to work on the edit please. I want this on the early news.

Sophie springs the hard-drive caddy from the camera.

ANDY
With great pleasure.

RALPH
Damn it...

Andy takes the hard-drive and heads over to the laptop.

EXT. LANDING PAD - DAY

A gurney wheels away from the copter, held against the wind by half a dozen strong men as the wind and rain buffet the platform.

The copter tries to take off upwards, but as soon as it lifts off the wind picks it up and drives it sideways off the platform and it plunges towards the sea.

At the last second it straightens up and flies out, just metres above the swirling waves.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Sophie Havers and Andy checkout Andy's final cut of the news item.

SOPHIE
Brilliant, send it.

Andy hits enter - it's off.

HAVERS
Nice scoop Sophie.

SOPHIE
It's going to make her life a misery.

HAVERS

SOPHIE
She wants the power, she can take the knocks.

ANDY
A member of Cameron's inner circle defecting is going to give us a great boost.

HAVERS
Us?

ANDY
Greens. And I was there, brilliant.

SOPHIE
Could it be her pregnancy, really?

HAVERS
In my experience women are barely make any sense at the best of times - a pregnant women is probably the most irrational creature in the universe.

SOPHIE
You are a cunt Havers.

HAVERS
And you love it. Now if you don't mind I am going to find myself a mindless thriller to read while this storm blows over.

He gets up and goes to the thriller stack.

ANDY
Are you ok?

SOPHIE
We're stuck here, I've got 36 hours to get the morning after pill, after that I'll have to get an abortion and you ask me if I'm ok?!

ANDY
You don't even know if you're pregnant yet.

SOPHIE
I can feel it.

ANDY
If you're so certain then maybe we could talk about it, together.

SOPHIE
I am not bringing a child into this world - end of story.

ANDY
I'm working for a better world Sophie, what are you doing?

That stops her. She can only shrug.

EXT. OCEAN - DAY

The rig sits in the middle of a weather cauldron - the raging sea reaches high up the rig's legs. Clouds close even tighter around the platform.

It's like the rig is being suffocated by the weather.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

People are killing time as the storm rages outside.

Havers is deep in his novel, Flint reads papers from her red box, Sophie has her camera set on a tripod and is cleaning it.

Ralph is closely monitoring Flint's laptop. He doesn't like what he sees.

RALPH
Here's another one Flint. This one's bad too.

FLINT
Read it.

RALPH
The headline is 'Cameron set alight by own energy czar'. They are loving this, bastards.

FLINT
Any email from the boss yet?

RALPH
He'll call won't he?

FLINT

Phone's off.

HAVERS
You've got balls.

RALPH
This is such a fucking mess... I can't believe this is happening to me.

HAVERS
Can't handle the real world eh Eton boy?

Havers rattles ice in his glass.

Ralph gives him a filthy look.

SOPHIE
Havers... haven't you got anything useful to do?

HAVERS
I could find some more alcohol.

SOPHIE
(Dry)
That would really help...

HAVERS
If we're going to be stuck on this miserable tub we might as well have a party tonight...

Havers gets up and cruises out.

SOPHIE
Andy?

Andy pokes his head up from his laptop. She beckons him over, all the while keeping a watchful eye on Flint.

Andy comes up to her, she nods her head down at the camera's viewfinder. The red light is on - she's recording.

The viewfinder is filled with Flint's face. Seen this way it's clear she is not reading - she is staring at Ralph.

Sophie writes on a pad "She doesn't blink".

Andy looks back at the viewfinder - Sophie is right, she doesn't.

SOPHIE
There's something strange going on.

Andy writes "She's a politician, she isn't human".

Sophie shakes her head, looks back to the viewfinder - Flint is staring straight at her, not blinking.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT

Andy is playing music videos on the projector.

Fletcher, Sophie and Andy huddle together.

FLETCHER
The autopsy in Aberdeen found nothing wrong with Emily.

SOPHIE
That's good then.

FLETCHER
No. People have to die of something. But a thirty year old dying of nothing is highly unusual.

ANDY
Murder?

FLETCHER
Unlikely.

SOPHIE
What about Flint - anything unusual about her?

FLETCHER
No one has stood up to Cameron and lived to tell the tale.

ANDY
What she said was amazing, fucking amazing. She is going to be an environmental hero, a legend.

SOPHIE
If she's on the level.

ANDY
Why do you find it so hard to believe that someone might change their mind for the good?

SOPHIE
It's not that Andy.

ANDY
I'm getting a bit sick of your negativity.

FLETCHER
I did have to give her a valium this afternoon.

SOPHIE
Valium?

FLETCHER
When the comms link went down. She got panicked about being out of contact with her husband.

ANDY
Valium... what else have you got?
FLETCHER
Everything is signed for Andy.

SOPHIE
I think she killed Emily.

ANDY
Sophie...

FLETCHER
Got any evidence for that accusation lassie?

She shakes her head.

SOPHIE
A gut feeling. Fletcher, can people die of fright?

Andy and Fletcher share a look.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT

Flint has moved closer to talk to Andy, Sophie and Fletcher. Havers pours Ralph a long drink. Ralph already looks like he's a long way towards oblivion.

Flint speaks with manic conviction.

FLINT
Nature fights. Every being on the planet fights to protect it's advantages. Fights to the death.

ANDY
But humanity... we've gone beyond that, we work together, we can make the changes to preserve the planet.

FLINT
The planet will fight back. And just like any other animal it will fight with passion and as much force as it can.

SOPHIE
What made you change your mind?

Flint rubs her eyes.

FLINT
A dream... a nightmare... I don't really know.

She stands and abruptly leaves.

Sophie looks at Fletcher, raises her eyebrows. He shrugs.

Sophie keeps watching Flint as she crosses to Ralph, sitting down next to him on the couch, very close.

Sophie nudges Andy - he turns to see Flint put her hand on the startled Ralph's leg. Flint leans right into him and her hand runs up to Ralph's crutch.

ANDY
Fucking hell...

Ralph squirms up and out of the way, hurriedly makes his way over to the others.

Flint then moves over the couch to Havers who is practically drooling.

SOPHIE
Havers? Jesus, she is desperate.

FLETCHER
So much for missing her husband.

SOPHIE
Are we going to let this happen?

ANDY
They're adults.

SOPHIE
Supposedly.

Sophie makes snap decision and crosses to Havers.

Flint has her hand on Havers chest, has moved in close.

Havers, well drunk, is openly checking her out.

FLINT
It's not like I can get pregnant is it?

Sophie taps Havers on the shoulder.

SOPHIE
Time you went to bed Havers. Your own bed.

FLINT
Fuck off bitch, he's mine.

Sophie is taken aback.

HAVERS
You heard what the minister said...

Havers staggers up and, supported by a surprisingly strong Flint, makes his way out of the lounge.

Sophie goes to follow them but Andy pulls her back.

ANDY
Come on Sophie, you can't go there.

SOPHIE
Jesus...

ANDY
So she needs a bit of company now that her life is falling apart - what's the worst that could happen?

Sophie resolve weakens, she turns away.

In the corner of the room Fletcher hands Ralph a bin - he throws up into it...

INT. HAVERS' CABIN - NIGHT

Havers is fumbling and drunk, messily trying to kiss Flint. Flint just goes straight for his crotch, trying to get him hard.

HAVERS
Go easy...

FLINT
Shut up.

HAVERS
Forceful... I like it.

She silences him by slapping her hand on his mouth. She pushes him down to her bed, opens his flies and sits on him.

She goes hard at it. Havers enjoys it then starts to have trouble breathing. Flint, stronger than him, keeps pushing down on his face until she comes with a deep growl - there's not much pleasure here, this is about

need.

She keeps her hands on his face... he starts to run out of breath, starts to struggle. He can't move, he realises he could die.

Just as Havers is about to pass out Flint releases her hands and Havers gasps for air. After a few desperate breaths he looks up at Flint. She is cold and unmoved.

FLINT
Did you like that?

Havers goes to speak but can only croak. He shakes his head, still scared.

She moves back on him, puts her face closer to his.

FLINT
This is what a man likes isn't it - something dirty...

Havers struggles to speak, to plead. He's not liking this as all, starts to cry as she kisses him on the chest. He reacts with small cries of involuntary pleasure which turn to pain as she bites him.

There's blood on her teeth and mouth as she looks at him the next time - he is struggling to scream, but she places her hand over his mouth again and goes back to gnawing out his guts.

She gives herself over to the pleasure of eating, a wolf at a carcass.

EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

Flint carries Havers' carcass, wrapped in bloody bedclothes, to the edge of the platform. The weather is still terrible. Flint is dressed in her normal clothes and gets soaked through, but shows no awareness of the cold.

She lifts him easily onto the handrail and tosses him over, some of his guts spill back onto the deck. She picks them up and throws them off the side too.

She looks over to the bridge between the rig and the hotel, moves towards it. She glances into men's cabins as she goes, sees outlines of men doing ordinary things - reading, watching TV, playing cards with their friends.

Circling the hotel, she examines all the equipment.

Opening a door she looks in - a brightly lit stairway spirals down beneath her. She heads down...

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Sophie, Andy, Ralph sit down for breakfast - a fry up of eggs, bacon, sausages and beans - hangover food.

RALPH
Chances of getting off this shithole today?

ANDY
Nil. They've stopped drilling now, just a skeleton staff on the platform itself, they're really worried.

RALPH
Great...

ANDY
Rough couple of days?

RALPH
Flint's gone nuts, she'll lose her job, I'll get promoted sideways, if I am lucky.

SOPHIE
And she hit on you.

RALPH
She knows I'm gay.

ANDY
And now we all do...

Ralph shrugs, he's in no state to care.

RALPH
I thought we were a good team, that we had some respect for each other.

SOPHIE
And she ended up with Havers.

RALPH
I don't know what has gotten into her.

ANDY
She's married.

SOPHIE

ANDY
She's pregnant...

At that moment Flint walks in. The groups falls quiet and watches her as she goes to the counter and gets her breakfast.

Flint sits down with her plate and starts to tuck in.

Sophie looks at her plate and gags. Andy looks down... Flint is eating raw bacon and sausages.

Ralph looks at her like she is mad.

Flint realises something is wrong.

FLINT
Pregnancy... cravings...

She stands up again, takes the plate back to the kitchentte and tosses the meat onto the pan where it sizzles brightly.

Flint bursts into tears and runs from the room.

ANDY
Looks like she had a great night full of uplifting emotion and feelings of love and well being...

SOPHIE
Havers... he'll be shattered... better go and wake him up then.

She stuffs a last bit of bacon in her mouth and gets up.

INT. HAVERS' CABIN - DAY

Fletcher and Sophie stand by Havers' bed. The sheets have gone but there is a massive clot of blood pooling on top of the mattress.

SOPHIE
Looks like our killer is getting angrier.

Fletcher turns away from the bed, pulls Sophie with him.

FLETCHER
I'm going to try and keep this from the rest of the crew ok, no point in spreading panic.

Sophie nods.

INT. FLINT'S CABIN - DAY

Sophie stands in the doorway, Flint is lying in bed.

SOPHIE
But if you did want anyone to talk to...

FLINT
You'd be a sympathetic ear would you?

Sophie sits on the edge of the bed. Flint sniffs the air.

FLINT
You're pregnant too aren't you?

SOPHIE
No. I might be. It's only been a couple of days.

FLINT
No my girl, you are. Well now... I thought you hated the world and everything in it?

SOPHIE
I won't keep it.

FLINT
You are a sad person aren't you?

Sophie looks away from Flint's staring eyes, pulls herself together.

SOPHIE
What happened last night?

FLINT
I went and had a drink with Havers, then I came back to my room.

SOPHIE
So where did he go?

FLINT
Are you the police? Do you have authority?

Sophie shakes her head.

Flint touches Sophie's arm.

FLINT

FLINT
I wanted this baby, I really wanted it, but something bad has happened, I can feel it...

The grip on Sophie's arm becomes harder and harder - Sophie pulls back, then really has to stand and wrench herself free from Flint's grip - and the penetrating, pleading look in her eyes.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Sophie, Andy and Ralph shelter in an alcove in the hotel's infrastructure while a couple of Oil Men dressed against the weather work with a rope at the railing.

From over to the side Fletcher looks on.

They tug upwards, using all their strength to pull at something, like trying to land a fish.

Something gives and Havers torso springs over the rail, shedding blood all over the disgusted oil men, one of whom slips on the wet deck and plunges into it.

Sophie looks away, hiding in Andy's arms.

Havers intestines trail over the side of the railings.

One of the Oil Men returns to the intestines. He pulls them up and eventually a hip bone and one leg come up.

The oil man dumps it like so much rubbish onto the soaking carcass.

Holding his hand in front of his mouth Fletcher goes in and takes a closer look.

He looks up to Sophie, he's worried.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Flecther takes a sip of whisky. Sophie, Andy and Ralph watch him expectantly.

FLETCHER
It wasn't suicide that's for sure.

SOPHIE
Flint.

FLETCHER
He was eaten alive. There were teeth marks on the bones, they... Jesus...

SOPHIE
Flint.

FLETCHER
There are 150 men aboard this rig, it could be any of them.

ANDY
Flint.

FLETCHER
Even if it was her we have no evidence, I don't have any DNA kit, until the storm passes it's hopeless.

SOPHIE
We could get her into a cell.

RALPH
Without evidence it's kidnapping. Kidnapping a member of the cabinet. That's life.

SOPHIE
You only get to go to jail if you're alive Ralph.

ANDY
It can't be her, she wants to save the planet, it doesn't make sense.

FLETCHER
We need to know it's her Sophie, before we can do anything.

Sophie stands up and slams the desk in frustration.

SOPHIE
It's her!

ANDY
Calm down Soph, it's not unreasonable to want some fucking evidence it it?

FLETCHER
Let me see if I can talk to her when she next comes in. She's due soon.

He picks up a bottle of Valium and rattles it.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Sophie walks purposely, Andy and Ralph in tow.

RALPH
You are mad, you know that.

SOPHIE
It's her.

ANDY
It's not her!

Andy pulls her round to a stop.

ANDY
Stop! Look, let's take a moment here... you've not been feeling well, maybe

SOPHIE
So I killed Emily and ate Havers did I?

ANDY
I'm not saying that.

SOPHIE
What are you saying Andy?

ANDY
Maybe you need to calm down a bit that's all. You're wound up too tight.

RALPH
Overwrought.

Sophie looks at Andy.

SOPHIE
I'm not enjoying your lack of support Andy.

ANDY
It's not that I don't support you, I just think you're wrong. We're not talking about how big your bum looks in pair jeans Sophie, this is serious.

SOPHIE
You can't even start to think I might be right because you think the sun shines out of her arse. Maybe you wanted to go with her last night.

ANDY
(kidding)
She might have been more fun.

SOPHIE
Fuck you. We're over.

Sophie turns and continues on her own.

RALPH
Very bad use of humour Andrew, I think you blew it.

ANDY
Maybe I wanted to blow it. Maybe I've had enough.

RALPH
DVD and a drink then?

Andy nods, they head the opposite way up the corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Sophie walks, angry, head down, almost clatters into Flint.

Flint brushes by looking odd. She is nervous, her bodily movements jerky.

Sophie waits for her to pass, watches her go down the the corridor and into Fletcher's office.

Sophie makes up her mind, heads towards Flint's cabin.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Fletcher has a board on Flint's tongue, looking down her throat with his light.

FLETCHER
I just can't justify giving you more Valium without a physical examination. You're a pregnant woman, you're exhibiting signs of distress and anxiety.

He places his light into her ears.

FLINT
It's just stress. I've committed political suicide, I can't reach my husband.

Fletcher straightens up for a moment to look her in the eye.

FLETCHER
I' m sure it is. Now look at me...

He holds the light up to her pupils. He flinches, tries to control it, drops his light.

FLINT
Everything all right?

Fletcher kneels down to pick up his light.

FLETCHER
Fine.

FLINT
Want to examine anything else?

He is kneeling in front of her, her tone is lascivious.

Fletcher ignores the suggestiveness and stand up.

FLETCHER
Could I feel the baby?

Flint raises her shift to reveal her bump. Fletcher places his hand on it, probes around. There's something wrong.

FLETCHER
Anything unusual with... with it?

FLINT
No. Can you feel it move?

FLETCHER
Yes, yes I can.

Flint grabs his hand and pushes it between her legs. He snatches it out.

FLINT
Not another fucking pansy.

She slips off the examination couch and rapidly exits the room, snatching the bottle of Valium on the way.

Flint sniffs his hand and winces.

INT. FLINT'S CABIN - DAY

Sophie is going through Flint's suitcase, trying to find anything incriminating. It's the usual stuff - clothes, toiletries, bills.

She crosses to the bed and runs her hand under it - nothing. But she sees something on the bed.

Looking closer she sees a slimy substance with what looks like glitter and sequins in it. She pulls out a pocket knife and quickly unscrews the top off a bottle

of Flint's hand cream. Carefully she lifts the substance off the sheet and scrapes it off into the lid.

The doors springs open - it's Flint.

Sophie doesn't hesitate - before Flint can register what Sophie is doing she launches herself at Flint with full force, pushing her back out into the corridor, slamming her onto her back, then scrambling off her and running away.

Flint is left groaning on the floor, clutching her stomach in pain.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Sophie crashes in on Fletcher, who is pouring himself a drink.

SOPHIE
Fletcher, I found something in her room... it's... I don't know what it is, but it isn't good... she must be...

Fletcher pours her a drink too and hands it to her.

She downs it - rough as hell, but it makes her stop and catch her breath.

FLETCHER
Show me.

Sophie hands him the lid.

He crosses to a work bench, scrapes the gunk onto a slide and pops in under a microscope.

Fletcher takes a look.

FLETCHER
Jesus Christ.

He looks ill.

SOPHIE
What is it?

FLETCHER
They're scales, like off a lizard.

SOPHIE
Why would they be in her bed?

FLETCHER
When I examined her eye's... the light bounced back.

SOPHIE
So?

FLETCHER
Like a cat's eyes. Another animal.

SOPHIE
But that's impossible.

FLETCHER
Yes. It is.

SOPHIE
What the fuck is going on here?

Fletcher goes to his drugs cabinet

and gets out a vial, fills a big fat

needle with the entire contents.

FLETCHER
This is intramuscular sedative, stab her with it and push it all in, she should drop like a stone. Get Andy and Ralph to help you. I'm going to see the captain, try and get him to arrest her.

SOPHIE
He won't like that much.

FLETCHER
I have to try. Sophie, I think Flint has been infected by a new virus. I think she is becoming animal, part reptile, part carnivore, all predator.

SOPHIE
The body of an animal, the brain of a human...

FLETCHER
Very very dangerous. Are you ready for this?

He holds out the needle. She takes it and goes.

INT. LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Andy and Ralph are watching 'Jaws'. Ralph is enthusiastically sitting forward, completely into it.

RALPH
This is marvelous isn't it?

ANDY
You strike me as an unlikely horror fan Ralph.

RALPH
Politics and horror are closely related.

Sophie rushes in, pulls the plug on the projector.

ANDY
You'll ruin the bulb doing that.

SOPHIE
We haven't got much time. Fletcher and I have evidence that Flint is the murderer.

RALPH
Impossible.

SOPHIE
I need your help. Fletcher gave me this...

She shows them the needle.

SOPHIE
To knock her out. It's for her own good.

ANDY
Fletcher gave you that?

SOPHIE
He's convinced. She said she wanted to stop the drilling right?

RALPH
At cabinet level obviously.

SOPHIE
What if she wanted to take a more direct route?

ANDY
Like what?

SOPHIE
Stop the drilling by knocking people off.

RALPH
It would take a lot of dead people to do that.

SOPHIE

RALPH
Exactly.

ANDY
You have lost it.

SOPHIE
Fine. I'll go and risk my life while you two big strong men sit and watch movies...

Andy stands up, sighs.

ANDY
Ok ok, I'll help. What have I got to lose?

RALPH
Aside from your job and your liberty?

ANDY
You are coming too...

RALPH
No fear.

Andy drags Ralph up by his tie.

ANDY
She's still your boss isn't she?

RALPH
Yes.

ANDY
So protect her interests...

Andy pushes Ralph away from him.

ANDY
So clever girl, where do we find her?

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Sophie stands by a diagrammatic map of the hotel and all its floors. Sophie and Andy have hard hats, work clothes, a rope, an axe, torches. Sophie also has her camera. Ralph has refused the trend to be more masculine and only has a hard-hat on.

SOPHIE
So if you were going to hide on an oil rig where would you go?

ANDY

SOPHIE
Down.

SOPHIE

Then that's where we are going...

Sophie pulls the map off the wall and hands it to Ralph.

INT. INTERNAL STAIRS - DAY

Sophie opens the door - they are staring down the same internal stairwell that Flint took earlier.

They walk as quietly as they can down the spiraling staircase. Outside the storm rages against the hotel and it creaks and shudders under the strain.

Stopping, they consult the map, then choose a deck to get off at the lowest deck 'A'.

INT. CASSION ONE - DAY

They come to an amazing sight - the inside of the hollow steel cassions that drop hundreds of feet into the ocean. They walk around one on a gangway, right where the body of the hotel is bolted on. Sophie shines a light into it - the beam is swallowed by the limitless dark.

The endless thumping of the sea can he heard, transformed into a deep dull pounding.

ANDY
Amazing engineering. You wouldn't want to fall down it though...

Ralph pokes his head over the edge - and pulls it back immediately.

RALPH
My god... this place is unnatural.

Sophie 'shhses' them and they continue to walk, leaving this caisson behind coming to a gangplank that crosses towards the next. The gangway is steel mesh and open to the swirling open sea beneath - the storm continues to rage.

Sophie takes a big breath and starts to cross over. Andy starts to follow - but Ralph grabs him.

RALPH

RALPH
This is madness.

ANDY
Daddy can't help you now eh? You can go back anytime...

Andy sets out across the gangplank.

Ralph looks back behind them. Darkness and steel. It's not an appealing prospect. He practically runs across the gangway to join Andy and Sophie who wait for him on the other side.

INT. JUNCTION - DAY

Ralph gets across to the other side where a number of gangways join together at a junction and puts his hands on his knees to catch his breath.

SOPHIE
You all right?

RALPH
I'll be okey-dokey in a moment.

ANDY
Okey Dokey?!

Ralph points at something at floor level.

RALPH
What's that?

Andy takes a look. It's a block of something with wires and a timer attached. The time is counting down from five minutes.

ANDY
Explosives. Shit.
SOPHIE
Well it's quicker than eating everyone.

RALPH
So she's not waiting for cabinet.

ANDY
You have to admire her drive...

SOPHIE
Later. Can you defuse it?

ANDY

SOPHIE
We should be able to just pull the terminals out. Unless she's got them booby trapped, then we are mince.
She's working fast, she won't be doing anything fancy.

RALPH
Where did she learn to do this?

SOPHIE
Ok, pull it...

ANDY
Me?

Sophie pushes him out of the way and just pulls the timer with the terminals out of the explosive.

ANDY
No!!

Nothing happens. Sophie pockets the timer and the explosives.

SOPHIE
Come on...

Sophie clicks off her torch, the others follow suit.

Sophie follows the wires...

INT. CAISSON TWO - DAY

They make their way along the wire, towards another caisson.

Sophie sees something - a light about 10 metres further on.

She stops and ducks down, signalling to Andy who nods and turns back to Ralph.

Sophie creeps forward on her hands and knees - it's hard to see much. She gets her camera, lays it on the gangplank, flicks it on and zooms in.

The image on the view finder is grainy, but there's no mistaking Flint. She has a large knife at a HOSTAGE'S back. The hostage is kneeling by the edge of the cassion, wiring another charge by the light of his head

torch.

Flint smells something. She turns back to where Sophie is enwrapped in gloom. There's a small red light blinking.

Too late Sophie realises that she's been spotted - slams the camera record button off and stays completely still.

FLINT
Sophie! You made it just in time... come on over...

Sophie stays where she is.

FLINT
Come on over or I'll kill him.

Sophie stands and walks slowly towards Flint. As she walks we see her ready the syringe. She gets to six feet away and stops, Flint's knife pointing right at her.

Flint pokes the hostage with the knife.

FLINT
Set it.

The hostage is completely shitting himself and quakes with fear, but he can't do it.

SOPHIE
You're going to kill 150 men?

FLINT
Whoops. Set it!

He can't do it, he half collapses with stress. Flint puts the knife to his throat, exposing her side to Sophie.

Sophie takes the moment and leaps forward with the syringe. She plunges it into Flints thigh and rolls to the gangway.

Flint looks down - the needle is buried deep but the syringe isn't fully pushed in.

FLINT
Oh look - there's some left...

Sophie looks up at Flint, still strong.

Flint pushes the syringe fully home - she sighs with

pleasure.

FLINT
Mmmmmm... that's very pleasant, nice of you to think of me.

There's not a chance of her going to sleep. Flint trains the knife on Sophie as she stands and moves back.

FLINT

FLINT
You put up a good fight Sophie. Tell you what, I'll give you and your daughter a chance.

SOPHIE
Daughter?

FLINT
Daughter. Shall we take this up on the main platform in say, five minutes?

She nudges the pushes the knife into the back of the hostages head. He sets a timer. She nudges him again, reluctantly he sets it off.

Flint pushes him over the edge of the caisson with her foot. He doesn't even have time to scream as he disappears into the darkness.

FLINT
Bye bye.

Flint sprints off into the darkness.

Sophie pulls the timer out of the explosives, runs the other way, back to Andy and Ralph.

SOPHIE
Ok, I defused that one.

ANDY
But there could be more...

SOPHIE
Yes, we've got to run... come on!

She sprints back over the walkway, Andy and Ralph follow.

INT. INTERNAL STAIRS - DAY

They run as fast as their exhausted legs can carry them, hauling themselves up the stairs. Andy stops for a

second and drops as much as he can out of his pockets, shrugs off his heavy jacket.

ANDY
Sophie... Sophie!

Sophie keeps going, leading the way.

SOPHIE
What?

ANDY
Lighten up, drop the camera...

Sophie looks down at the camera - there's no way she's leaving it behind. She grits her teeth and keeps going.

EXT. HOTEL - PLATFORM LEVEL - DAY

They break outside - the shock of the storm after the insulated quiet of inside the hotel is immense and they stand in shock for a moment, ripped at by the wind and rain.

Sophie looks ahead and sees Flint moving into the start of the bridge to the main platform.

Sophie crosses to a window - looking in she sees a whole bunch of Oil Men playing cards and drinking, enjoying their down time.

She slams her hands on the window.

SOPHIE
Get out... Get out now!

A GOOD NATURED OIL MAN waves backs at her from inside the window, beckoning her to get in out of the cold.

Andy grabs her and forcably pushes her towards the bridge.

They get to within ten metres of it when the first charge blows.

The hotel shakes and shudders as the charges go off in series around the rig, throwing everyone to their knees.

A moment of stillness when it seems that nothing has happened.

Then a creaking sound. And the hotel starts to twist and buckle, the platform deck they are on tilts downwards

and the hotel starts to fall away from the main platform.

Desperately they try to walk up the buckling deck towards the bridge. They have to cling together to make it.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

The bridge has a open industrial mesh floor and handrails, all covered by a steel roof.

Already it's dangerously tilted as they enter - and it just gets steeper and steeper as the hotel collapses back and away.

As they struggle upwards Sophie takes a look backwards.

She sees the hotel not only tipping back but starting to tilt sideways, placing incredible sheer forces on the bridge.

The hotel begins to shake from internal explosions, each shudder jolting the bridge, making them cling on for dear life.

It's steep now, they hang onto the handrails and dig their toes into the mesh and slowly make their way up.

As they reach halfway there's a final sudden wrench and the hotel and the bridge part company.

The Hotel subsides into the heaving waves, digested by the Ocean.

The bridge drops, but still attached to the main platform it pivots down. They desperately cling to it as best they can as it gains speed and slams against the side of the main rig.

Sophie looses grip on one hand and her feet fall away - she's holding on with one hand from the handrail.

There's a hundred feet of dirty air between her and the surging ocean.

Her hands slips, she drops ten feet before the hood of her jacket catches on a stanchion and she is crashed back into the walkway, her head taking the full weight of the impact.

Knocked senseless she dangles from the stanchion like a doll, the upward force on the jacket pulling her arms up.

From above Andy watches in horror. He starts down the handrail, using it like a vertical ladder.

Ralph goes the opposite direction, climbing up towards the main platform.

Andy reaches Sophie - swings across and pins her body to the railing, hanging on with all his might.

He shouts above the wind.

ANDY
Sophie... Sophie!

She's out cold.

Looking around he realises things are pretty desperate.

With Sophie a dead weight he won't be able to hang on forever and there's no way to get her up.

With tremendous effort he raises one arm and slaps her on the face to try and wake her up. She remains out of it.

Gritting his teeth in the wind and rain he holds on, but he is beginning to fade...

Something sails past him and hits him on the back of the head. It's a thin rope with a couple of big loop ties into it.

He leans into a loop, it gives and drops a foot, scaring the hell out if him, but then holds firm. He eases Sophie back onto him, taking her weight.

Looking up he sees Ralph waving.

The rope begins to steadily rise.

INT. MAIN PLATFORM - DAY

Andy and Sophie are hauled up over the edge of the main platfrom, Ralph and Fletcher are both there hauling the rope up by hand.

Everyone collapses with the effort and shock. Andy starts to laugh.

RALPH
What's so funny?

ANDY
Sophie's still got her fucking camera on.

Sure enough the camera is intact, slung around her shoulder, the red light blinking - she managed to record it all.

Sophie comes around, feels her face.

SOPHIE
What the fuck happened there?

ANDY
I saved your arse.

SOPHIE
I didn't ask you to.

ANDY
I didn't need your permission.

SOPHIE
(Softens)
Thanks.

She sees her camera blinking, switches it off.

INT. DAY ROOM - DAY

They huddle in a small day room - a place where Oil Men would take a coffee break. They are drying off as best they can and clutch water bottles.

Fletcher has found a packet of biscuits and hands them around.

SOPHIE
She's ruthless, prepared to kill.

ANDY
We have to assume she's going to blow this rig too.

FLETCHER
If she did that she'd be killing herself.

RALPH
There might not be anyone left to help her now.

SOPHIE
How many men on this platform Fletcher?

FLETCHER
Not many, skeleton crew, so six to eight.

RALPH
Only ten of us against her?

SOPHIE
Ok, so if she's not going to blow the rig what's she going to do? Once this storm goes there will be swarms of police over this thing.

RALPH
So we wait for them.

FLETCHER
You think she's going to let us survive?

SOPHIE
We shouldn't make any assumptions about her or what she wants to do. Least of all that she's human anymore.

RALPH
You can't be serious...

FLETCHER
I agree with Sophie - I've seen the samples. She's a hybrid.

SOPHIE
A human brain with an animals body. And appetites.

ANDY
A great hunter then.

That sinks in.

RALPH
All the more reason to stay in here and lie low.

ANDY
Yeah, lets watch some TV, take a shower and iron our fucking shirts...

SOPHIE
I'm not waiting around to be picked off.

FLETCHER
And there's the other men.

RALPH
Forget them, they're as good as dead right?

ANDY
We don't know that.

FLETCHER
We have to find them.

SOPHIE
Let's get on with it then...

She throws the biscuits to Andy who tucks them in his pocket.

ANDY
So where do we start then?

FLETCHER
At the beginning...

Sophie gets up, looks around - Fletcher leads the way.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

They all walk cautiously along a darkened corridor, all with a hand-tool at the ready - a hammer, a knife.

They stop at the first door they come to.

Andy signs "1,2,3". Andy opens the door, Fletcher steps into the room, checks around him, nothing.

He comes back out and they start down another corridor that looks exactly the same.

First door they come to, they go two each side. Andy signs "1,2,3" springs it open and steps back. Ralph's turn to look in...

Nothing.

RALPH
My heart stops everytime...

ANDY
Better get used to it.

They continue up the corridor to the next room... it's a long slow process.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

They reach room with a sign on it 'Workshop 3'.

They get ready to enter, sane drill. Andy signs "1,2" -

A loud and piercing male scream comes from within.

They instinctively back away around a corner

ANDY
That'll be them then.

RALPH
What's she doing to them?

FLETCHER
Nothing good. We have to get them out.

RALPH
Off you go them.

SOPHIE
All of us.

ANDY
We can't just go in there blind...

FLETCHER
There might be windows on the other side.

Fletcher heads another way around the workshop.

INT. OPPOSITE CORRIDOR - DAY

The windows are high up.

Sophie signals to Andy - he cups his hands and gives her a lift up so she can look in the room.

SOPHIE
Fuck me...

INT. WORKSHOP 3 - DAY

It's a big room, large work benches all around. Tied down to the tables are SIX OIL MEN, each of them missing a foot and a hand, each of them gagged.

The SIXTH MAN is being lashed to a bench by Flint. She is covered in blood and gore. Stronger than before she easily holding down the resisting Oil Man.

Aware of his fate he puts in one last effort to get away. Flint swats him with her free hand and he is knocked senseless.

She finishes tying him down, picks up a battery operated jigsaw. She lops off his foot.

It clatters onto the floor and his stump starts to spray blood. She slops a paint brush out of a bucket filled with crude oil and splashes it on his stump. Then she uses a small gas blow torch to set the oil alight, sealing the wound.

Flint then moves onto one of his hands...

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Sophie signals to be lowered down.

SOPHIE
Fletcher take a look... she's busy, she won't see you.

ANDY
What is it?

Sophie can't bring herself to say anything, shakes her head.

Fletcher hikes up in Andy's hands.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

They have backed off down a corridor, somewhere it's safe to talk.

FLETCHER
The men won't die, not of those wounds. She's cauterized them well, just like they would have before they invented anaesthetic.

ANDY
Why has she done it?

SOPHIE
We know she eats people, right?

RALPH
So?

SOPHIE
It's a storehouse.

ANDY
Shit me...

FLETCHER
She's got enough for a couple of days, more than enough time to bring down the rig.

SOPHIE
She is behaving more like an animal.

RALPH
It makes her really strong.

SOPHIE
Yes, but there must be limitations. Every animal has it's weak spots, we just have to find hers.

RALPH
Before she eats us. Which won't be long now, lets face it.

ANDY
Your attitude is getting on my tits.

RALPH
I'm going for survival here, if you want to save those guys, go be the fucking hero, just don't involve me.

Andy grabs Ralph and pins him to the wall.

ANDY
We have to work together. I know you're a fucking Tory, so that won't come naturally to you, but it's the only way we're going to get off this shit hole all right?

He pushes Ralph harder against the wall, choking him.

Sophie and Fletcher pull him back, releasing Ralph.

RALPH
Keep the ape away from me.

SOPHIE
We work together. You, me the ape, we'll even work with the Scot - got it?

Ralph looks to Fletcher for support. Fletcher stares back.

RALPH
Wouldn't it at least make sense to find out how long the storm is going to last?

Sophie looks hard at him, she should have thought of this - nods.

INT. WEATHER STATION - DAY

The four of them crowd into the platform's bridge which is jam packed with computers, weather faxes and comms machinery. Ths station has a good view of the ocean too - but they can barely see out of the windows - the storm still pushes in on the rig, with no sign of abating.

Fletcher picks up the ship to shore radio and tries the 'talk' button - there's a massive squall of static. He drops it.

Andy picks up a roll of fax paper.

ANDY
What's this?

Fletcher takes it off his hands.

FLETCHER
Weather Fax.

RALPH
How long do we have to wait?

FLETCHER
We don't. According to this the whole North sea is bathed in sunlight and calm as a mill pond for the next two days.

SOPHIE
We've got our own private storm?

Fletcher crosses to a radar screen - the radar sweep catches a dense squall in the centre that drop off quickly.

FLETCHER
That's exactly what we've got - there is a storm on the rig - here - but the rest of the area is calm.

Andy looks closer. There are five or six dots flaring close to the rig.

ANDY
What are those dots?

FLETCHER
Ships, just outside the storm.

RALPH
They've come for us?!

FLETCHER
They can't come closer in though.

RALPH
So we wait.

SOPHIE
This storm is never going to end while she is on board.

ANDY
She can control the weather too now? Come on Sophie.

SOPHIE
I'm looking for a better explanation, but I can't see one - how about you?

Andy can't think of anything either, shrugs.

SOPHIE
We can't wait.

RALPH
What are we going to do, just run in there and pull them out?

SOPHIE
That would be naive Ralph. We have to prepare something better for her.

FLETCHER
Loyalty is shift Ralph?

RALPH
She has to be caught. Calmed. We can't kill her.

SOPHIE
Can't we? Fletcher.

FLETCHER
I think killing her is probably the only way we are going to stop her now.

RALPH
Just because we're on an oilrig doesn't mean there's no law. You're talking about murder.

ANDY
Don't worry, no one is going to make you shoot her.

FLETCHER
We don't even have a gun.

SOPHIE
So lets think about how we might do it...

She pulls the block of explosive and detonator/timer out of her pockets.

SOPHIE
Do you think these might be useful?

Andy picks them up.

ANDY
Oh baby...

He's got a big smile on.

INT. CORRIDOR BY WORKSHOP 3 - DAY

The are tooled up, armed with hammers, a flare gun.

Sophie drops from looking in the window - then counts 1,2,3 with her fingers...

Ralph springs the door and they rush in.

Flint is eating one of the Oil Men, her head buried in his torso.

Sophie rushes forward, Andy and Fletcher split to the sides.

Flint pulls her face out of the carcass and looks around.

FLINT
Visitors, how lovely.

Andy levels a flare gun at her - she's a sitting duck.

Suddenly Flint leaps straight upwards, twisting in mid air and disappearing into semi-darkness amongst the pipes.

Sophie flicks on her torch.

ANDY
Up up up!

Sophie shines the torch up to the ceiling. Flint is hanging there with the casual ease of a bat.

Andy fires the flare right at her. She easily ducks it.

The flare lights up the room in its full horror - The eaten and messily digested remains of the two men are spread about while the others look on in abject terror, straining at their ropes.

The flare pops its chute and drops down towards one of the men. A deadly hot magnesium poker, it falls on him.

His screams and grunts fill the room as the flare melts his flesh onto the bench.

Flint scuttles over the roof towards Fletcher, who is still mesmerised by the painful death of the Oil Man.

SOPHIE
Fletcher!

Sophie drops her torch and throws a hammer as hard as she can towards Flint - it connects enough to divert her attention from Fletcher.

Flint moves back to Sophie, growling, she's got her undivided attention now.

SOPHIE
Fletcher, Andy - now!

Fletcher and Ralph get out of the door as fast as they can. Andy stops in the doorway and looks back in the middle of the room to see Flint get really close to Sophie.

Sophie flicks on her camera and films Flint from the hip, capturing the blood and gore seared face, the twitchy movements and her heavy breathing.

Flint smiles for the camera.

SOPHIE

Is there anything you'd like to say?

Flint speaks with a little difficulty.

FLINT
To whom?

SOPHIE
The country. Your husband. Your unborn baby.

Flint moves right in on the camera.

FLINT
Don't fuck with Mother Nature.

As she opens her mouth and roars with the force of a bear it's evident just how far towards the animal she has gone - her teeth are distorted, canine, her tongue is thick and black.

Sophie is petrified, glued to the spot by the onrush of sound and hatred.

FLINT
Cut.

Sophie flicks the camera off.

ANDY
Duck!

Sophie instinctively drops down and runs toward the door as Andy fires a nail gun at Flint.

One strikes home, pierces Flint's cheek, another one in her arm, buying Sophie enough time to duck out the door.

As she does so Ralph and Fletcher slam it shut and they all run like crazy down the corridor.

Sophie looks back as she turns - Flint bursts from the door and is following them, approaching at an amazing speed.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

They continue to run with Flint in pursuit and catching fast.

It looks like they are running straight at a wall.

Andy gets to it first, he lifts a hatch in the floor and they drop one by one down it.

Sophie makes it in just as Flint gets there...

INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY

Sophie drops to the floor as Flint's hand makes the hatchway.

Andy pulls the hatch down with all his might and throws the lever that secures the hatch door in place.

He flicks the timer on the detonator.

ANDY
5, 4, 3...

SOPHIE
Come on...

ANDY
2, 1, Go!

They strain to listen.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY.

On the ceiling a pack of explosive.

The corridor is empty.

The bomb rips it up, turns it into a fireball.

INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY

They are hunched against the blast, ears in agony from the explosion.

Andy shakes it off first.

ANDY
If that didn't kill her nothing will.

FLETCHER
Good work Andy.

RALPH
So who's going out to check she's dead?

No one is game.

Sophie goes to the hatch, gingerly pushes it up enough to look out. Nothing.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

The hatch lifts into the blackened corridor - Sophie's face a a pale sliver of expectation.

Behind, unseen, Flint waits, perfectly ok.

As the hatch raises higher Flint reaches it from behind and starts to slowly pull it back.

Sophie suddenly realises that it's moving of it's own accord - she ducks back down and puts all her body weight on the handle beneath.

INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY

Sophie hangs from the hatch handle, legs in mid air.

SOPHIE
She's there - pull me down!

Andy and Fletcher reach up and grab her legs.

Sophie keeps going up, Flint relentlessly pulling it from above.

SOPHIE
She's too strong...

ANDY
Ralph, take my place - quickly!

Ralph takes Sophies leg.

SOPHIE
Andy!

Andy picks up a hammer and starts smashing at Flint's fingers on the underside of the hatch - blood starts flying around the room.

Flint lets go with a terrible scream and the hatch comes crashing down, severing the hammers shaft as it does so.

Everyone ends up in a tangled heap on the floor, Andy is the only one left standing - he slams home the lock on the hatch - safe.

They slowly disentangle themselves.

Sitting around, shocked, staring at each other.

RALPH
Well that was successful.

Andy turns aggressively to him.

ANDY
Shut the fuck up!

Fletcher pulls Andy back.

FLETCHER
Hey, Andy...

ANDY
What are you going to do Ralph, negotiate?

FLETCHER
It was a good idea. It's no one's fault it didn't work.

RALPH
Even so... we are back to square one.

SOPHIE
Did you forget to take your anti-depressants this morning Ralph?

RALPH
Just stating a fact.

FLETCHER
Everyone's ok, that's the main thing.

ANDY
I killed that man, he's not ok.

SOPHIE
It was an accident Andy.

ANDY
He's fucking dead. What if he had a family? A kid?

FLETCHER
A lot of men have died already Andy.

SOPHIE
Did you set out to kill him?

Andy shakes his head. She puts out her hand - he takes it.

FLETCHER
It was a good idea. We just need a better one.

No one has a better idea.

SOPHIE
Cup of tea?

Tensions breaks - laughter.

FLETCHER
And some rest. We need to recover.

ANDY
What about the men back there?

FLETCHER

ANDY
If the aim is to save them rather than just die stupidly, then we need rest. And a cup of tea.

INT. PANIC ROOM - NIGHT

Fletcher sleeps as best he can under a pile of blankets.

Ralph is wide awake, gently rocking himself, scraping out the bottom of a cold can of beans.

Sophie and Andy huddle together under a collection of coats.

ANDY
If it is a girl, what will she be like?

SOPHIE
I'm not going to

ANDY
I know, I know... we're pretty close to dying here Soph, can you let me imagine what might be?

Sophie softens, holds him.

SOPHIE
She's be clever like you and have my beauty of course, and she would be brave.

ANDY
Like you.

SOPHIE
Brave enough to make sense of this world.

ANDY
The greatest gift anyone could give a child would be optimism, given the general shit state of the planet.

SOPHIE
Yes. Exactly.

Andy reaches over and puts his hand gently on Sophie's stomach and kisses her.

She wipes away a tear from her eye.

Andy pulls her into him, she settles in and tries to get some sleep.

EXT. PLATFORM - DAY

The morning sun casts a pale light into the edges of the storm that still rage and shake the platform. There is no abating, it's as strong as ever, no sign of it easing away.

INT. CORRIDOR BY PANIC ROOM - DAY

Flint lurks around the hatch into the panic room.

She is noticeably more animal like now - twitchy and tense, circling and enraged.

INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY

Drinking teas brewed on a small camping stove, muching biscuits, waking up.

Sophie has her camera on. She points it at Fletcher.

SOPHIE
Want to tell me that story about the Capri and the dog?

FLETCHER
No way lassie, some wounds are too deep.

SOPHIE
Anything you'd like to say to the world?

FLETCHER
Uncle Chan's, Glasgow, best fried rice on the Planet.

She turns her camera to Andy,

SOPHIE
You?

ANDY
I want to live. I want to live so I can save the world, all the generations to come.

FLETCHER
Show me up why don't you?

ANDY
It you're going to have an aim in life it might as well be big right? Right Sophie?

SOPHIE
It seems to me that most of the problems of the world come from men wanting big things.

FLETCHER
Boom boom.

SOPHIE
You know what I mean. Ralph?

Ralph ignores the camera.

RALPH
We know that there are ships out there, just a mile away right?

ANDY
But trying to lower a boat a hundred feet in a storm?

RALPH
We've proved that we can't kill her.

SOPHIE
I just don't think it will work.

RALPH
It has to. I'm not going to sit here and just wait.

ANDY
We stick together.

RALPH
So come and help me.

Ralph looks around the group.

FLETCHER
It's a bad plan. She'll be onto you as soon as you open that hatch. She might be there, just waiting for you now.

RALPH
She knows me. She won't kill me. She couldn't.

SOPHIE
She's an animal.

RALPH
She knows me.

He gets up and before anyone can move is up and out the hatch.

INT. CORRIDOR BY PANIC ROOM - DAY

Ralph pushes himself up into the corridor, looks around - just him.

He closes the hatch and walks off towards the outside of the platform.

As he rounds a corner Flint appears from the shadows and follows him.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Ralph walks cautiously down a corridor. Something catches his attention out of the corner of his eye and he stops suddenly, looking left.

A pair of tropical fish move lazily around a tanks, a perfect tropical paradise.

Unseen by Ralph, a reflection of Flint in the glass.

Ralph smiles, turns back to keep walking and stares straight into the face of Flint.

He jumps back.

Flint doesn't move. Up close she is a picture of gore, her face and clothes sluiced with dirty black blood. In contrast her manner is civil and warm.

FLINT
Don't worry Ralph, I'm not going to hurt you. How could I?

RALPH
We both know you couldn't.

FLINT
No. It would me a mockery of our professional relationship. Dare I say it - our friendship.

Ralph continues to walk, Flint joins him, linking an arm through his.

FLINT
The Prime Minister's not going to believe this is he?

RALPH
It's incredible.

FLINT

RALPH
Been quite some time since a politician has been so... pro-active.
Quite.

They have reached a hatch that leads to the platform.

Ralph lets go of Flint's arm, pulls on a wooly hat and puts up his hood.

RALPH
Charming weather we are having. Anything to do with you is it?

FLINT
Mother has arranged it. Until the job is done.

RALPH
I see. And what is the job exactly?

FLINT
If you stay you'll get to see.

RALPH
Ah...

FLINT
You are staying aren't you?

RALPH
I'm not sure that I can Flint. Nothing personal, I just want to survive. You'll let me do that won't you? You owe me that much...

He looks for reassurance - what he gets is a smile.

Ralph opens the hatch and steps outside, followed by Flint...

EXT. PLATFORM EXTERIOR - DAY

They step into the filthy weather, there's not a chance of talking above the wind.

Ralph walks against the storm, towards a lifeboat that sits under a derrick, closely followed by Flint.

He reads a info-graphic that shows how to release the lifeboat. He pushes a lever and a spool of thin wire begins to turn. He turns his attention of the derrick arms, pushing first one then another out.

He turns to the lifeboat and begins to push it out - it hangs in space for a moment, suspended on it's two wires, he gets ready to jump up onto it.

One end of the boat suddenly drops away, the wire has given way. Ralph turns back to look at what's gone wrong.

Then he feels it - it looks down at his middle and sees the wire wrapped around his stomach, the other end is clipped to a stanchion just out of his reach.

Flint is stood at the control box. She pushes a button and the wire starts to tighten, drawing close around Ralph's middle.

Try as he might he cannot release the clip or escape the grip of the tightening wire.

She gives him a cheery wave.

His screams are drowned out by the weather - frantically he looks to Flint - she blows him a kiss.

The wire gets tighter and tighter, first cutting deeply into his coat, then his guts.

The hatch bursts open and Sophie and Andy look out to see Ralph cut in two, his torso toppling to the wet deck, his legs falling like a couple of skittles.

They remain unseen by Flint as she walks away up the deck, into the weather, Ralph's torso trailing behind her...

INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY

Sophie. Fletcher. Andy.

Before them is a map of the rig with scrawls over it. A new plan.

Andy hands Sophie a flare gun and a couple of flares. He gets his own and loads it with a flare - she follows his example, step by step. Got it.

ANDY
Don't stop running.

Fletcher nods, he has a flare gun in one hand, a hip flask in the other, he opens the top and offers it to Sophie.

SOPHIE
I think we're missing something.

FLETCHER
A choice?

SOPHIE
We aren't being smart. We need to think about how to take advantage of her weaknesses.

ANDY
What are her weaknesses exactly Sophie?

FLETCHER
She is fast, strong, smart, violent, driven.

SOPHIE
I know, but... there must be something. There's something about her eyes?

FLETCHER
She can see in the dark, like a cat. The retina is ten times more sensitive than a humans so they have a shutter that closes over the top. It's not a weakness it's an adaptation.

ANDY
The only advantages we have over animals is thinking, and she has that too...

Andy reaches out and takes the whisky from Sophie and has a chug, hands it to Fletcher who has his tug, he hands it out towards Sophie...

She downs it - bite of raw whisky, the acknowledgment of danger and of friendship.

Fletcher screws the cap back on and tucks the bottle back into his jacket.

He listens very carefully and pushes the hatch up.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Fletcher pours a large plastic drum of thick crude oil onto the floor of a corridor. It settles and looks like dark glossy lino.

Andy pours a topper of petrol over the oil, the fumes form a thin haze in the corridor.

Sophie is at the other end of the corridor, standing back, her flare gun behind her back.

SOPHIE
(very quietly)
Good luck!

Andy and Fletcher look at each other, nod, and they are off.

INT. CORRIDOR BY WORKSHOP 3 - DAY

Fletcher approaches the door to workshop 3. He places his ear against it, listening for activity. Nothing. He looks back to Andy, shrugs.

Suddenly the metal of the door is punched outwards, right beside his face. He reels backwards then gets himself together and runs as fast as he can.

Behind him the workshop door springs open and Flint runs after him.

INT - CORRIDORS - DAY

Fletcher running through a tightly twisting set of corridors and doorways, the fact he knows where he is going means he can just keep ahead of Flint.

They break out into a broader wide open corridor - Flint is now catching up with Fletcher fast, it looks like it's all over.

A flare snakes down a side corridor and bursts close to Flint. She stops and looks up the side corridor to see Andy - who runs off.

Enraged, she goes after him.

The chase is on - this time Andy ducks and dives through corridors, making a circle around one level of the rig, just keeping ahead of Flint.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

An interior door crashes open and Andy starts down a steel mesh stairwell. He gets two levels down...

ANDY
Go!

He then nips out another door, while towards the bottom

of the stair Fletcher starts to run down the stairs.

Flint comes through the door, looks down, gives chase.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Andy listens to Flint clatter past down the stairwell then takes off in another direction.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Fletcher springs out of the stairwell and runs left, then right and left again through a tight section of entrance hatches.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Fletcher runs into the kitchen, though a servery, behind the stoves and towards the provision area with a large walk-in fridge.

He stops. Panting hard with exhaustion and adrenaline he checks behind him - is he being followed?

Flint's not behind him. He spins around, desperately searching for her. Nothing.

Cautiously, flare gun in front, he starts to go back the way he came... past the stoves... towards the servery...

BANG - he is hit in the face with a pan.

Flint, holding the pan, laughs at her own silly joke.

Fletcher touches his nose - it's broken.

He turns to run again but Flint is much faster - she grips his head from behind and puts her fingers into his eyes. He drops the flare gun, crumples to his knees.

Flint pushes him along in front of her, then marches him into the walk-in fridge, slams the door and secures it with a soup ladle.

It rattles, the door being pushed from inside, but it won't budge.

INT. TRAP CORRIDOR - DAY

Sophie waits.

The sound of running.

Andy appears at the other end of the corridor.

ANDY
Where is he?

SOPHIE
I don't know.

ANDY
Fuck! I'll go back.

SOPHIE
No!

Andy turns to go, but Flint is right there, catches him.

Andy is pushed forward - Flint is behind him, arms around his midrift, forcing him towards Sophie.

Sophie raises the flare gun.

ANDY
DO IT!

Flint stops.

FLINT
Do what Andy?

Andy unconsciously looks down at his feet, the thick black ooze.

Flint leans down, puts a finger into it and tastes it.

FLINT
I see...

ANDY
Sophie!

Sophie stands there, shaking - is she prepared to kill Andy and Flint at the same time?!

ANDY
Don't think about it...

Sophie squeezes the trigger on the flare gun.

Nothing happens, it's jammed.

SOPHIE
Fuck!

She tries to free it, but is bundle of nerves and drops the flare onto the floor.

She looks up to Flint.

FLINT
Takeaway... thanks.

Flint drags Andy back and around the corner, leaving Sophie alone.

INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY

Sophie angrily searches though provisions looking for weapons. Nothing much there.

She stops, falls apart, this is too much.

Unconsciously she touches her stomach, looks down at it, rubs it. Breathing heavily she forces herself to focus by rhythmically stroking her tummy.

SOPHIE
What do you think love? Can Mummy get you through this?

She grabs the rig map. Getting some paper and a pen she makes a hasty copy.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Flint has wrapped gaffer around Andy's mouth. She casually starts to wrap him in tape, softly humming to herself as if she were wrapping a child's birthday present.

INT. WEATHER STATION - DAY

Sophie ducks into the room, checks the weather station - the screens show that nothing has changed.

She goes through the draws looking for weaponry.

Nothing.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Andy lies on the floor of the main kitchen, wrapped in gaffer tape and completely helpless.

The Fridge door clicks shut.

Flint tosses a freezing and iced up but still alive Fletcher onto the floor next to Andy. Fletcher holds an

empty bottle of Whisky.

Flint calmly stands over Fletcher, who is shivering, trying to speak.

She moves closer to him to hear what he says.

FLETCHER
Fuck you.

She nods, then stands.

She throws up over him - a massive, impossible amount of bile showers down on him.

It's acidic, caustic - first there's the billowing steam of something hot hitting cold, then the acid burns down into the screaming Fletcher. He's thawing out and being burned alive at the same time. Horrible sounds come from him, the sound of a doctor confronting his own mortality too early.

Andy pitches and wriggles, trying to get away from the acid as it seeps over the floor.

Fletcher is soon a syrupy, sticky mess.

Flint searches the kitchen draws, pulls out a tablespoon, sits down next to Fletcher and starts to eat him like a good seafood chowder.

Andy screams behind his gaffer tape as she calmly watches him, enjoying his panic.

INT. HEATING DUCT - DAY

Sophie shimmies along a heating duct, barely big enough for her. In her teeth she has a massive knife.

INT. WORKSHOP 3 - DAY

Flint has tied Andy up in a similar manner to the other men.

She has the battery operated jigsaw and holds it up for Andy to see.

He screams behind his gaffer tape and twists and turns in vain.

She lops off one of his hands then paints it with crude oil and lights it with a zippo.

Andy struggles to calm himself, to stay in control despite the pain.

She moves down to his foot and starts with the jigsaw.

But the battery is running down and the blade snaps - it sticks in the bone, one end protruding above the skin.

In the sudden silence Flint hears something, looks up to the ceiling.

Andy hears it too, starts shaking his head, shouting a warning ineffectually into the gaffer tape.

INT. HEATING DUCT - DAY

From behind Sophie there's noise.

She tries to look back but the duct is so tight she can't move her head.

The ducting is ripped out behind her like it is so much cardboard.

She tries to hold on as it tips backwards, but there's nothing to grab and she slips backwards into freefall.

INT. WORKSHOP 3 - DAY

Sophie falls feet first into the middle of the workshop, taking a sharp tumble and coming to rest sprawled on the floor, dazed, her knife off to one side.

She snaps alert and grabs for the knife.

Too late, the knife is picked up by Flint.

FLINT
Planning to make me a meal were you?

Sophie bellows, launches herself to her feet and runs straight at Flint - who effortlessly flicks her aside, rattling her back to the floor.

FLINT
Are you sure that's good for the baby?

Sophie rises to her feet again, grimacing.

Flint plays obsessively with the Zippo lighter.

FLINT
Any signs of morning sickness yet? Mine was hell for three months, then it dropped away.

SOPHIE
Fuck yourself.

FLINT
I wish. If I could have had the baby by myself I would have. My husband is a powerful captain of industry, but he is also a monumental shit.

SOPHIE
How long did it take you to figure that out?

FLINT
Things changed when he figured out that I could make PM one day. When I could out perform him.

SOPHIE
That's all in the past now then.

FLINT
I would imagine that my current dietary requirements would make living with him difficult.

SOPHIE
What happened?

FLINT
I think I have been possessed by the spirit of Mother Nature. A very vengeful Mother Nature.

SOPHIE
She want's the rig destroyed.

FLINT
For a start. Then in another few hours, once I have finished my current stock of food, I will swim to the mainland and bare my babies.

SOPHIE
Twins?

FLINT
Come closer...

Sophie steps nearer. FLint opens her blood-encrusted jacket to show her stomach. It's a twisting seething mass.

FLINT

FLINT
They ate my baby for food. They want to come out to play.

SOPHIE
You lost your baby?

FLINT
Nature adapts. I am evolving rather quickly.

SOPHIE
I noticed.

FLINT
We will stop the rape of the earth. A goal of which you should approve.

SOPHIE
I approve of the goal. Your methods leave me cold.

FLINT
Well that puts up at odds doesn't it?

SOPHIE
I think we always were.

FLINT
Then I think I will have to eat you. Eat you both.

Flint moves closer to Sophie, sniffing the air, salivating.

SOPHIE
Can I just say goodbye to Andy?

Flint stops, nods her approval.

Sophie goes to Andy who has been watching all of this.

Blood still gushes out of the raw wound on his foot, the jigsaw blade still protruding through the skin.

He is pale, rapidly losing his life.

Sophie pulls at the gaffer on his face, carefully lifting it enough so that he can talk.

SOPHIE
Andy...

ANDY
Please... think about keeping the baby?

SOPHIE
I'll keep it.

Andy smiles. She kisses him. As she pulls back he whispers...

ANDY
My ankle...

SOPHIE
It hurts?

Andy shakes his head.

ANDY
Use it.

He passes out.

Sophie cries out and lays her head on his chest, sobbing.

She is also sheilding Flint's view of the rest of Andy's body. She keeps pretending to cry and looks down at the ankle - sees the blade sticking up from the bone and reaches down for it.

FLINT
Got that over with?

Flint closes in behind Sophie...

Sophie yanks the blade and in one movement whirls round and drives it towards Flint's face.

It sinks a couple of inces into Flint's eye.

Flint, half-blinded and in agony, spins around. Sophie uses the confusion to run for the door, scooping the Zippo off the floor as she goes.

Flint controls herself then, with a mighty roar, pulls the blade clean out, tossing it aside as she makes for the door.

INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRWELL - DAY

Sophie runs until she finds a stairwell, then sprints down it.

As she makes her way down she pushes every door open, each one making a loud crash as it slams closed.

She ducks out of one, stops, her back flat to the wall.

Catching her breath she has a thought, sniffs herself.

Nose wrinkling, she smells rank.

The stairwell echoes with the sound of Flint coming down, Sophie moves away quickly.

INT. OFFICES - DAY

Sophie works her way through the office section of the ship near the weather station, quietly opening cupboards and drawers, desperately searching for something, anything that will help.

She finds a big torch. Flicks it on, looks into the lens to see how strong it is. Really strong.

She screws up her eyes, blinks, tries to get her bearings.

It makes her think. She closes one eye and dazzles herself again.

An idea. She pockets the torch.

INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

She tries the nest room - a training room.

Bingo - a video projector. She pulls it away from it's powerpoint, zips it into a carry case, and grabs a small bottle of meths by the white board.

Listening before she exits again.

All quiet, she can leave.

INT. PANIC ROOM - DAY

She drops down into the Panic Room with the case.

Working very quickly she puts her camera on a tripod and strikes up a small light.

Setting the camera to record, she crouches in front of it.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

She makes her way along a corridor, listening as she goes. She is carrying the projector case and Andy's laptop under her arm.

EXT. PLATFORM - DAY

Sophie steps out into the storm, gashing with shock as she is lashed by wind and rain.

She goes to the moon pool, finds a pipeline and walks along it, following it back inside the rig.

INT. PIPE ROOM - DAY

Sophie follows the pipe into a room full of them - a curling mass of engineering.

She places the laptop and projector high up on a bench.

Sees a big valve outlet on the pipe secured with a lever. She tries to open it by leaning on it - it's firm.

She climbs up on the piping and puts her feet on the lever and starts bouncing with all her might on it.

Suddenly it springs open, gushing the thick dark crude into the room. She falls from the lever and into the dark flow. It's really strong near the pipe, she struggles to keep her head above the surging gluttonous mass as it tips her up and slams her against a wall.

She fights to stand up, stands still for a moment then ducks back into the crude, using her hands to slick it through her hair, over her face. All that is left uncovered by the mask of oil are her eyes, two vulnerable, light-filled spheres.

The crude is flooding the room, building up behind the door, up to her chest - she's got to get going.

She grabs the laptop and projector and pushes the door out.

She spills out, managing to keep her equipment high and out of harms way.

Crude starts rapidly flooding out over the rig.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

The blackened Sophie comes out of a stairwell and makes her way along a corridor.

She looks up and sees the crude oil beginning to seep through the whole rig, big glutinous dollops of it start

to drop like black rain.

She chooses a dark corridor, and creeps down it.

Finding a powerpoint in the wall she quietly unzips the projector bag.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Flint makes her way down a corridor, searching for Sophie. Her damaged eye is pussy and covered in drying blood - there's no way she can see out of it.

We see the corridor from Flint's point of view - cloudy, full of shadow and flat - the result of having no binocular vision.

She hears something, her head snaps around.

SOPHIE
(V.O)
Help! Flint... help me... someone...

Flint turns around and moves very quickly towards it.

INT. SOPHIE'S CORRIDOR - DAY

Flint comes around the corner, keeps walking, sniffing, awkwardly looking around her with her one eye.

She sees Sophie huddled at the other end, clutching her tummy.

SOPHIE
I think I'm losing it... Flint, help!

Sophie extends her hand towards Flint.

Flint moves in for the kill, walking quickly up the corridor.

SOPHIE
Help! Flint... help me... I think I'm losing it... Flint, help!

Flint moves within a couple of feet, salivating at the prospect of eating her.

But there is something wrong with the image in front of her.

She moves her arms and a shadow crosses over Sophie, the hard light of the projector on her arm. She turns and

gets a flash of the projector - then a bright torch lights flashes in her eyes as well as the oil-black Sophie springs up from a dark corner behind her.

Flint is dazed, turns to try and shake it.

Sophie begins her plantive call again...

SOPHIE
(real one)
Help! Flint... help me...

I think I'm losing it... Flint, help!

Flint turns back, confused as to where the image and voice are coming from... just in time to get a face full of the bottom of a fire extinguisher.

Sophie stands back from the stunned Flint and blasts her face with sticky foam, blinding her.

Flint circles, rubbing the foam out of her eyes. She clears it over her good eye and looks to see Sophie standing there with a bucket.

Sophie tosses a bucket of meths over her.

FLINT
Sophie... not my babies...

SOPHIE
The world needs my children, not yours.

Sophie strikes up the Zippo, places it to the meths on the floor.

Flint, turns to run but she is caught and goes up like a Guy Fawkes effigy.

Screaming in the flame, Flint is bought to her knees and then topples to the floor.

Sophie gets her camera from around her neck and moves in closer to Flint, recording the pictures of the twitching, dying Flint. A few seconds is enough. She stops recording.

Sophie stands back from the heat - it's over. She slumps to the ground and starts crying from suppressed grief and relief.

A large dollop of crude drops from the ceiling, landing

next to the flaming carcass of Flint. The oil lights up.

Another dollop drops from above, adding to the intensity of the flame.

The fire jumps from patch of oil to patch of oil, suddenly the whole corridor leaps into flame.

Sophie feels the heat, snaps to - a wall of flame.

Picking up the extinguisher she blasts a path out of the corridor - just as she turns the corner there is a ROARING BLAST OF FLAME that knocks her to her feet, dropping the extinguisher.

She gathers herself and runs for the outside of the rig.

EXT. PLATFORM - DAY

Bursting from the inside Sophie hunkers down, expecting to be pelted by rain and cold. But the storm is clearing rapidly, dissolving like candy floss in rain.

There are five or six ships waiting off the edge of the rig. A DESTROYER is moving in.

Behind her the doors are blown off their hinges by another SHUDDERING BLAST and the rig shakes to its core.

Sophie looks around - goes to where there are a couple of liferafts. Looks at the instructions.

Another blast behind. There's not going to be time for getting the raft off.

She unhooks one end of a liferaft cable, clips it to her belt, sets the cable running and steps off the side of the platform...

EXT. NORTH SEA - DAY

A flaming oil rig.

On one side a small figure is being lowered on a wire.

Above her the top of the rig is enveloped in flame.

A duck speeds away from the Destroyer, into danger.

The rig shudders sending Sophie swinging as she descends - first right out to sea, then back into the tangle of pipes under the rig.

She doesn't get caught up, but as she spins back out

towards the ocean she unclips and falls the remaining 50 feet into the cold ocean.

The rig goes up, a vast metallic funeral pyre, and begins to slide down into the water.

EXT. OCEAN - DAY

Looking up on the rig as it slides into the ocean - the thin spindle of the pipeline begins to crumple - pipes split away and topple slowly in the water, overtaken on their trip to the bottom by the falling mass of the rig.

EXT. OCEAN FLOOR - DAY

At the point where the pipes enter the ocean floor they buckle and break as the rig comes straight down on top of it.

INT. EARTH'S CRUST - DAY

The vast bulk of the wounded creature squirms and howls, then relief as the pipe that pierces can be shaken free.

The creature sighs, turns lazily over, circulating it's bulk inside the earth, free to move again.

EXT. DUCK - DAY

The duck, piloted by two NAVY GUYS, races toward a figure floating in the water - is she alive or dead?

Sophie has the strength to raise her arm.

A MINUTE LATER: The near frozen form of Sophie is pulled aboard the duck and sloshes into the bottom of the boat.

INT. DESTROYER SICK BAY - DAY

Sophie sits wrapped in a blanket, a cup of tea in her hands.

A TECHIE comes in with her camera and the hard-drive from it.

TECHIE
It'll need some work, but the hard drive seems to be readable. I'll pull it onto some discs for you.

SOPHIE
Great. Thank you.

TECHIE
Got some amazing footage then eh?

SOPHIE
Yes. Family movies.

TECHIE
On an oil rig?

SOPHIE
Who would have thought it?

She smiles at him. He smiles back, ducks out.

She takes a sip of her tea. The remembers something - fishes in her pocket and pulls out the zippo.

Yes, it still works.

THE END
